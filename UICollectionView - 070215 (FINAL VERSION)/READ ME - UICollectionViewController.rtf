UICollectionView Example

This project is an example of using view controllers with NSUserDefaults for persistence.

When the app is launched, four company names appear. Selecting any one of them brings up a new view controller.  
This new controller shows three of the company's products.

If any of the products are selected, another view controller loads with a URL, giving more information on that particular product.  
Products can be deleted on the second view controller, as well.
